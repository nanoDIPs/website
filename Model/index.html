      <h1>Modelling Drug Delivery</h1>
      Our novel approach to targeted drug delivery has been investigated further
      by simulating a region of a capillary and surrounding tissue using a
      system of partial differential equations (PDEs). Through making reasonable
      assumptions and simplifications of the modelled system, solutions were
      generated to describe the behaviour of the drug-carrying liposomes when
      they reach a region where cancerous cells are present in the tissue.

            Simplifications included examining the system as a one-dimensional
            state, where a single capillary traversed space parallel to this
            dimension, while surrounded by Extra Cellular Matrix (ECM). The flow
            of species within the system was appropriately simplified based on
            the following conditions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Steady flow rate of blood in the capillary across the length of
              the region examined
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A representative value for the velocity of blood in
                  capillaries was used for all simulations of u = 1 mm/s (Ivanov
                  et al., 1981)
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              No bulk flow in ECM (i.e. no convective transport of species) –
              mass transport only via molecular diffusion in this region
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Representative values for diffusivity of the species and
                  regions considered are documented in table 2 – all assumed to
                  be constant in space and time.
                </li>

              * Due to the size of the liposomes produced (diameter = ~150 nm),
              the order of magnitude for their diffusivity was based upon virus
              cells of similar size.

            Values for the drug in the system are based upon the Cisplatin
            molecule currently used as a chemotherapy product. Values for
            diffusivity in mammalian tissues are well documented in literature
            and used accordingly for this model, however, finding values for
            diffusivity in blood medium produced less relevant results. As in
            the capillary region of the model, the order of magnitude of the
            flow term present dominates the diffusion term (based on scaling
            analysis of the governing PDE), it was less pertinent to find
            accurate values for diffusivity in blood. It was therefore assumed
            that the diffusivity increased 10-fold when in blood, compared to
            ECM, due to being in fluid medium.

            Representing the complex process of exchange between the two regions
            in the system was critical. To minimise the complexity of modelling
            these processes, exchange was idealised as a one-step process with a
            constant rate coefficient describing it. Enabling the exchange
            processes to be represented in the PDEs concisely. Documented below
            is the rate coefficients used to describe the one-step exchanges and
            other key behaviours in the system, again assumed to be constant in
            space and time.
          </p>
          <img src="./assets/table3.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            *This value (and the other exchange rate coefficients) are based on 
            the work oh Koh et al. (2003) and should reasonably describe the rate 
            of the drug exchange across the boundary of the two regions. It has 
            been assumed that the rate of exchange of the liposomes is an order of 
            magnitude slower due to its larger size and that the forward and 
            backward rates are equal, which has its limitations due to knowing that
            the concentration gradient between the two regions will influence the 
            rate of exchange (Fick’s First Law). However, for the purposes of the 
            model, it is likely to not influence the overall dynamics significantly 
            to spend time on during this project. 
          <br />
          <p>
            The modelling of the exchange process was further simplified by not
            considering the system in two/three dimensions. Avoiding the need to
            describe stochastic Brownian motion that would be particularly
            complex to predict in the ECM region. Therefore, once in the ECM,
            the only possible behaviour possible is diffusion in the one
            dimension considered, exchange into the capillary or interaction
            between liposomes/drug molecules and protease.

            The PDEs required to model the system’s dynamics were formulated
            based on the general Convection-Diffusion Equation, with ‘reaction’
            terms incorporated describing the production/destruction of the
            species as they interact within the system.

            The generalised form can then be simplified for our system, through
            the assumption that blood is incompressible, removing the divergence
            of velocity term. For blood flow in capillaries, it is not ideal to
            apply this assumption, however, as the system is only examined in
            one-dimension and the blood flow is assumed steady, the derivative
            of it will still be zero if incompressibility was not assumed. As
            previously noted, diffusivity of all species is constant in time and
            space, removing the gradient of diffusivity term. Reducing the
            equation above as described and formulating it for each specie forms
            the basis of PDEs to be solved.

            Diffusion is described in these equations by the diffusivity
            multiplying the Laplacian of specie concentration, while the
            convection is the dot product of bulk velocity and gradient of
            specie concentration. The reaction terms, ‘R’, noted in these
            equations, were mathematically formulated based on the reaction
            pathways described in figure 2.

            The first reaction term accounts for each liposome containing
            multiple drug molecules through multiplying the second order term by
            50. The coefficient of 50 is based upon calculating the internal
            volume of a liposome with 150 nm diameter and finding the ratio of
            this with the volume of a Cisplatin molecule with diameter 30 nm. As
            the ratio found doesn’t account for the molecular forces between
            Cisplatin molecules, leaving empty space within the liposome, and
            assumes that a liposome is filled to maximum capacity when formed,
            the outputted value of ~100 was reduced to reasonably account for
            these factors.

            Therefore, using the two sets of equations developed, the dynamics
            of the system can be described. These can be solved through applying
            initial conditions for the concentrations of the species and
            reasonable boundary conditions to describe the physical system,
            producing the evolution of the five species’ concentration over a
            set time period.

            With these conditions the solver can now evaluate the concentration
            of each specie across the domain of each instance of time
            considered, outputting the desired dynamics. Referring to the system
            of PDEs, both the first and second order spatial derivatives need to
            be calculated, as well as calculating the reaction terms.

            For the solver developed in this project, a forward-difference
            method of calculating first order derivatives was not compatible.
            However, Newton’s difference quotient can still be used by utilising
            a backward-difference approach, as shown below, because this
            produces identical derivative calculations when the step size is
            suitably small and was compatible with our solver.

            With the second order derivatives calculated in a similar way,
            avoiding limitations of the numerical solving approach through the
            appropriate boundary conditions when points (x + h) and (x – h) do
            not exist. The functions in these definitions represent the
            concentration of the specie being examined at the specific spatial
            point. Therefore, these are the values of the concentration at that
            specific time instance, known through calculating the changes in
            their value at each time point evaluated, starting at the initial
            values provided.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The reaction terms can simply be calculated using the concentration
            values known for that time instance. With these steps completed, the
            change in concentration with respect to time can be calculated by
            inputting the calculated values for the unknowns into the PDE
            (previously described) for each specie. Concentrations are then
            known for the t+n (where n is the constant time step size) time
            instance through the time derivative values calculated at the
            previous time instance and this process can be iteratively completed
            for the time period specified.

            To add a dynamic cancer presence in the model, a ‘binary’ tumour was
            introduced into the ECM that was initialised as active at specified
            spatial points for t = 0. Protease concentration at points with an
            active tumour state will increase at a constant rate, simulating the
            production of the protease (biomarkers for our drug delivery method)
            by cancer cells. As the protease concentration rises, it may reach
            the threshold value to activate an adjacent point/’cell’ into
            switching to an active tumour state/’cancer cell’, producing an
            idealised cancer growth description. The values designated for
            production rate and threshold for spreading were based on giving

            to demonstrate the dynamics of in vivo interactions between our

          Greek letters are used to denote a domain (a group of consecutive
          nucleotides) and a bar above indicates the complement to that domain.
          Furthermore, a domain can be split further into superscripts and
          subscripts. A superscript of n indicates the n bases that are closes
          to the 5' part of the domain and subscript of n indicates all the
          other bases. For example a domain \( \beta \) can be used to describe
          5'-ACTGACGTACATGGA-3', which we can further split into: $$
          \overbrace{\underbrace{ACTGAC}_{\beta^{6}}
          \underbrace{GTACATGGA}_{\beta_{6}}}^{\beta} $$

          In this model, the biophysics of the toehold exchange process is
          established in 3 steps: $$ X(m,n) + S \ \overset{k_{f1}}{
          \underset{k_{r(\gamma^n )}}{\rightleftharpoons}} \ I(m,n) \
          \overset{k_{b}}{ \underset{k_{b}}{\rightleftharpoons}} \ J(m,n) \
          \overset{k_{r(\beta ^m)}}{ \underset{k_{f2}}{\rightleftharpoons}} \ Y
          + L(m,n) $$ In the 1st step, an invading strand \( X(m,n) \) binds to
          the substrate complex by toehold \( \bar{\gamma} ^n\). This is called
          the invading toehold. This reaction forms an Intermediate \( I(m,n) \)
          which represents all the branch migration states in which \( Y \) is
          bound to more bases of \( \bar{\beta}_m \) (i.e. \( X(m,n) \) is in
          the process of displacing \( Y \)). The second intermediate state \(
          J(m,n) \) conversely represents the states in which \( X(m,n) \) is
          bound to more bases of \( \beta_m \) (i.e. strand has been more than
          halfway displaced). After this stage, the toehold \( \beta^m \)
          dissociates and the forward reaction is complete, with the strand
          having been displaced.

          <br />
          <br />

          In this reaction, the rate constants \( k_{f1} \) and \( k_{f2} \)
          quantify the rates at which \( \gamma^n \) and \( \beta^m \) bind to
          their respective complements. Winfree assumes that they are equal to
          each other and denotes the overall hybridization rate \( k_f \) with a
          value of approximately \(3.5 \times 10^6 M^{-1} s^{-1} \). Note that
          this constant (along with \( k_b \)) is dependent on various features
          such as salt concentrations, temperatures and domain
          length/composition. Despite not being exactly accurate for our
          purposes, it provides a good approximation for this process.

          <br />
          <br />

          The first order rates at which the toeholds dissociate are given by:
          $$ k_{r(\gamma)} = k_{f1} \times \frac{2}{b-m} \times e^{\frac{\Delta
          G(\gamma^n)}{RT}} $$ where the \( b-m \) term (the length of the \(
          \beta_m \) domain) ensures that the relative concentrations at
          equilibrium are accurate and the binding energy is calculated using
          'The Thermodynamics of DNA Structural Motifs' (Hicks and Santa Lucia
          Jr. 2004). The expression for \( k_{r(\gamma^m)} \) is similar to
          this.

            Despite being modelled as a 3-step process, it has been shown (Mills
            & Yurke 2004) that toehold-mediated strand displacement can be
            approximated by bimolecular reactions with second-order rate
            constants. This can be displayed as: $$ X(m,n) + S \quad
            \overset{k_{(\beta^m, \beta_m, \gamma^n)}}{ \underset{k_{(\gamma^n,
            \beta_m, \beta^m}}{\rightleftharpoons}} \quad Y + L(m,n) $$ where
            these rate constants are related to the constants defined previously
            by: $$k_{(\beta^m, \beta_m, \gamma^n)} \equiv \frac{k_{r(\beta^m)}
            k_f k_b}{k_{r(\gamma^n)}k_{r(\beta^m)} + k_{r(\gamma^n)}k_b +
            k_{r(\gamma^m)}k_b} $$ To ensure that these simulations are accurate
            to within 50%, the concentration of \( X(m,n) \) must be kept below
            a certain critical concentration which for our purposes is \( 100nM
            - 1\mu M \). Below is a simulation of this process with the rate
            constants calculated for the two different toeholds: <br />

            The rate of this reaction also strongly depends on the composition
            of the toehold. Most estimates are made using mixed teoholds but
            toeholds can also be assigned as strong (exclusively G/C pairs) and
            weak (exclusively A/T). This results in a quantifiable difference in
            binding energy and therefore reaction rates due to the difference in
            number of Hydrogen bonds.
            <br />
            For the purposes of illustrating this difference, below is plotted
            the reaction rates for two domains of length m=6 with one composed
            of only G/C pairs and the other only with A/T pairs. It is clear to
            see that after 3 seconds there is a distinct difference in the rate
            at which this reaction occurs. <br />

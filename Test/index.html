  <h1>Liposome preparation</h1>
  Before embedding nanopores in the membranes of liposomes, we first had to prove that the protocols we developed (<a href="..\Build\index.html">described here</a>) result in uniformly-sized vesicles.
  To this aim, we performed dynamic-light scatter (DLS) experiments to analyse the size-distribution of the vesicles.
  We then used fluorescence sprectroscopy to demonstrate the encapsulation of the fluorophore sulforhodamine B  (SRB) within the liposomes.
  Lastly, we sought to purify the assembled liposomes from the unencapsulated SRB found in the liposome mixture. In order to achieve this, we performed size-exclusion chromatography. We found that our workflow robustly results in liposomes of high purity, even when using different buffers with different osmotic pressures.

         Assaying nanopore assembly enabled understanding whether another basic building block of the design had been achieved.
         Each of the 6 DNA strands that form the DNA nanopore barrel should hybridise with their neighbour. Therefore, in theory, strands 1&2, 2&3, 3&4, 4&5, 5&6 should anneal to each other in pairs. Strands 1&6 should also anneal, resulting in a continuous barrel structure.
         When each of these combinations of DNA strands are run separately on an agarose gel, the resultant DNA bands are positioned such that they correspond to the expected molecular weights upon annealing (table below).

         Furthermore, when all 6 bands of DNA are annealed together, the resulting band of DNA barely moves out of the well (FigXB). This is in accordance with the prediction of the molecular weight for the open nanopore. A similar result is also obtained for the closed nanopore, which additionally incorporates the lock DNA strand. However, simply incubating the 6 DNA strands together at room temperature, without annealing at 95°C, results in a smear of DNA. This smear occurs much farther away from the well and the position of the bands for the annealed closed and open nanopores. In fact, it appears within the range of much lower molecular weights for the pairs of DNA. This suggests that without annealing at 950C, the 6 DNA bands form varying combinations of hybrids but do not all anneal in the continuous barrel structure which would have resulted in a much higher molecular weight.
         Taken together, this data demonstrates that the closed and open nanopores are likely to have annealed in accordance with theoretical design and modelling predictions

  <h1>Nanopore-mediated release of fluorophore</h1>
  After having confirmed that we could form liposomes and assemble DNA nanopores, we had to demonstrate the we could embed the nanopores in the membrane of the vesicles.
  Then we had to prove that molecules could pass through the pore of the DNA nanopore and be released in the extra-vesicular space.
  We thus perfomed kinetic fluorescent spectroscopy experiments to demonstrate that SRB can be released from our nanopore-equipped liposomes.

        Fluorescence intensity over time of SRB-filled liposomes with (blue line) and without (green line) embedded open nanopores.
        Nanopores dissolved in buffer A were added to the phospholipid mixture prior to extrusion. The shaded region corresponds to standard deviation from 3 replicates.
        In the beginning the fluorescence levels remained close to zero in both samples due to fluorescence-quenching.
        However, when open nanopores are present in the membrane, SRB leaks from the vesicles over time. As it is no longer trapped inside in a high-concentration environment, the fluorescence of the sample increases until reaching a steady state after ca. 600 min. If no nanopores are embedded into the membrane, SRB stays inside the vesicle with minimal leakage (green curve).
        Taken together, these data demonstrates that the assembled nanopores can emben into the membrane of LUVs, allowing SRB to leak out.

        We demonstrated  the specificity of ligand-mediated opening of closed nanopores by comparing the effects of adding a key with perfect complementarity to the lock (blue curve) and a key containing mismatches in the sequence (pink curve). To obtain an endpoint value for the fluorescence, we treated nanopore-containing vesicles with 5 ul of 20% Triton X-100 (red curve).
        When the exact key is added, SRB is released from liposomes at a higher rate compared to the mismatch key. As a result, after 100 mins the abosulte fluorescence of the sample with the matching key ris approximately 3 times higher than the LUVs-NP-C containing the mismatch key.
        The dramatic increase in fluorescence following the addition of  Triton X-100 proved the encapsulation of SRB. The drop in fluorescence that follows may be explained by self-quenching at very high SRB concentrations.

         Firstly, we checked the functionality of the strand displacement reactions that would be triggered downstream of the protease cleavage. Here, the key DNA strand was annealed to another strand with a toehold. The addition of a ‘complement’ DNA lead in the key being released.
         The released key is then able to bind the modified toehold on the lock, and invades to displace the lock, thereby opening the previously closed nanopore.

         <img class="accordionFigure" src="assets\figures\fig7-page.png">
         Strand displacement mediated opening of DNA nanopore. A 25% polyacrylamide gel was used. In lane 4, the complement (C) strand would theoretically bind the toehold (T), displacing the key (K). This would allow the key to bind the lock strand. As a result, DNA bands corresponding to the following complexes should be visible: 21bp toehold-complement hybrid (K-T) and 88bp lock-key hybrid (L-K).
         Lanes 1-3 are controls. T-C = annealed toehold and complement DNA strands; L-K = annealed lock and key DNA strands; NPC = annealed closed nanopore; K-T = annealed key and toehold DNA strands; C = complement DNA strand. DNA strands were annealed in a PCR thermocycler as described in the (<a href="..\Build\index.html">Build</a>) page.

         Next, we checked that cleavage of the enzymatic site could trigger the nanopore to open. The digestion of a peptide bond was simulated by using a DNA strand with a SmaI restriction enzyme digestion site.
         The same DNA fragment was also modified to consist of complement and key-toehold sequences, and is collectively designated the ‘Key Kite’. Therefore, the addition of SmaI released the complement and this triggered the downstream reactions that were demonstrated to open the nanopore.
         Here, it is suggested that more nanopore open when SmaI is added along with the Key Kite.

         <h2>Fig.8 Restriction enzyme digestion triggers the opening of the DNA nanopore.</h2>
         <img class="accordionFigure" src="assets\figures\smau.png">
          A 15% polyacrylamide gel was used. From right to left: In the control lane 1, no bands are visible except for the darkly staining well, indicating the presence of an intact closed nanopore (NPCH). In control lane 2, NPCH is incubated with a DNA sequence designated Key Kite (KK). In lane 3, the restriction enzyme SmaI is also added. The KK consists of a SmaI recognition site, which can trigger the downstream displacement of DNA strands on the KK to ultimately release the key DNA strand. In lanes 2 and 3, band 1 likely corresponds to a 153bp complex of the 97bp KK and 56bp lock. This indicates promiscuous, undesired KK activity regardless of SmaI presence. Bands 2 and 3 likely correspond to lock-key and complement-toehold complexes. Notably, these bands are stronger in lane 3, when the SmaI is added. This is in spite of the volume of KK used in lane 3 being half that used in lane 2. KK and NPCH were separately annealed in a PCR thermocycler as described in the Build page. NPCH was incubated with KK, or with KK+SmaI for 30 minutes at room temperature prior to running the gel. The ladders shown belong to the same gel.
          Our experiments indicate a certain degree of promiscuous activity of the modified DNA sequences, resulting in some undesired lock-key complexes (Fig.8).
          Future research would involve further characterisation of the bands corresponding to such suspected promiscuous activity to improve the design of the sequences.
